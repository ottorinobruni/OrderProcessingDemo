# OrderProcessingDemo

This is a simple .NET Console Application that demonstrates how to use core collection types from the `System.Collections` namespace in C#.

It is part of the blog post:

## What It Shows

This example simulates a basic order processing system and demonstrates how to use:

- `List<T>` for storing dynamic collections of orders
- `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>` for fast lookups by order ID
- `Queue<T>` for processing orders in a FIFO order
- `Stack<T>` to implement a simple undo operation
- `IEnumerable<T>` with LINQ to filter and display data
